But at heart it&#x2019;s a story of revolution and insurgency. The story of the peasant baby that threatened an empire. So this year we&#x2019;ll be tugging the tail of our own empire state of mind, and &#x2018;re-membering&#x2019; Christmas together. <br> <br> Our service will incorporate some familiar aspects of the British Christmas, including the Nativity Play, the Queen&#x2019;s Speech, andeven a lovely Carol (thanks for coming Carol!) <br> <br> For our Christmas Dinner, we&#x2019;ll share the very basic elements of bread and wine, common to cultures around the world. Gluten free and non-alcoholic options will of course be available, please bring a cup.<br> <br> It would be extraordinary if we were to neglect to remember the present day reality of the &#x2018;little town&#x2019; of Jesus&#x2019; birth, a placewhere people still know occupation and oppression, so yes Palestine will also feature in our service. Our music will be led by DJ and Percussionist Sekrit with Mishael Lazarus on vocals. We will be joined by a cast of colourful characters (human and non-human), including John Bell, Liz Adekunle, Sami Awad, Nadia Bolz-Weber. And an angel.<br> <br> Dress for the season if you wish, but otherwise, just come as you are: and be ready for one or two surprises.<br> <br> Gather from 9.30 onward for Christmas party fun and games with Christian Aid and from 10.00 onward for music and warm-ups for a 10.30 service start time. And watch out for the Christmas characters around site."},{"title":"The Imagination as Essential to Faith","details":{"location":"Glade Big Top","day":"Monday","time":"10:15"},"desc":"This seminar is anathema to all who believe that Jesus was a silent baby born in a snowdrift with a mum dressed in blue.
