That day, armed with a flat cap and a piece of cardboard, Andrew Graystone walked to his local mosque in Manchester to stand guard during Friday prayers.  24 hours later his picture had been shared millions of times around the world and he was bombarded with messages of support from the Prime Minister of New Zealand to Jada Pinkett Smith. <br> <br> Andrew is a middle-aged, middle class, white Christian man who was brought up not to make a fuss. He is also a storyteller and a Greenbelt regular. With characteristic wit and wisdom he reflects on the power of tiny acts of rebellion, including visiting a mosque, stealing a library, and inviting Tommy Robinson for tea. <br> <br> Andrew&#x2019;s book Too Much Information? : Ten Essential Questions for Digital Christians (Canterbury Press) will be launched at Greenbelt."}]}
