Run, walk or jog: this isn&apos;t a race. It&apos;s a chance to meet other Greenbelters, see a bit more of the park and get some exercise. Some people will do it in under 20 minutes, while others will take the best part of an hour but you&apos;re guaranteed not to be last - a tail walker will walk at the back the whole route to make sure everyone is OK. <br> Meet at the Campsite Office in the main camping field for an 8:15am sharp start."}]}
