Having eschewed the whole band thing a few years back, he now uses minimal but rich instrumentation to accompany his raw, smoky voice. He draws on Americana, indie, country, rock, and ambient soundscape influences, blurring and breaking barriers, with provocative lyrics that convey a lifetime of hard-won wisdom."}]}
