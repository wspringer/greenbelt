The OK Chorale is for everyone to enjoy &#x2013; young, old, whether you can sing or not. With a house band of Greenbelters, led by Chris Read (of Harry &amp; Chris) belting out a repertoire of irresistible classics from the pop pantheon, we introduced the OK Chorale last year and it stole the show. It&apos;s now a &apos;thing&apos;. And we can&apos;t imagine finishing Greenbelt any other way. It will send you home with a smile and a sore throat. Like Beer and Hymns. But without the hymns."}]}
