It forms the inspiration for Turya&apos;s name. Her upbringing spanned several continents and cultures which deeply influenced her vocal and songwriting approach, and cultivated her resonant melodies with an immersive warmth and unique quality. These influences and experiences have helped create &#x2018;Ocean&apos;, Turya&#x2019;s elemental debut body of work."}]}
