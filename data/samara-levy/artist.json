Samara&#x2019;s story shows that&#x2019;s just not true. To date, she has organised more than one hundred containers of aid to go to those most in need in Syria (as well as Iraq and the wider Middle East), and has visited the war-torn country &#x2013; despite the high rates of killings, kidnappings and attacks on those delivering humanitarian aid &#x2013; many times. Samara&#x2019;s is a simple, extraordinary story of responding to a call and stepping out in faith.<br> <br> Samara Levy was a stay-at-home mum who felt called by God to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. She now heads up a charity which to date has directly helped more than 350,000 people in Syria and the wider Middle East, providing small field hospitals and medical care for around 3,000 people every month."}]}
