The OK Chorale is for everyone to enjoy &#x2013; young, old, whether you can sing or not. With a house band of Greenbelters, led by Chris Read (of Harry &amp; Chris) belting out a repertoire of irresistible classics from the pop pantheon, we introduced the OK Chorale last year and it stole the show. It&apos;s now a &apos;thing&apos;. And we can&apos;t imagine finishing Greenbelt any other way. It will send you home with a smile and a sore throat. Like Beer and Hymns. But without the hymns."},{"title":"Chris Read: Little Man","details":{"location":"Pagoda","day":"Monday","time":"17:15"},"desc":"Jazz musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and half of globe-trotting Harry and Chris presents a new show of comedic songs and soulful ballads, inspired by everything from starfish preservation to becoming a father. &#x2018;Up-and-coming talent&#x2019; (All About Jazz). &#x2018;Fantastic&#x2019; (Evening Standard). &#x2018;Musical genius&#x2019; (Russell Howard)"}]}
