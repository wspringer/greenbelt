This is very much the kind of thing Greenbelt can get behind. Born out of First Timers Festival &#x2013; an event aiming to do something about the lack of diversity in the punk scene &#x2013; Best Praxis brings a homegrown, edgy, inclusive blend of of grunge, funk and synth-punk.<br> <br> ------------------------<br> <br> Part of the Dream Nails Takeover programme where we say......GIRLS TO THE FRONT!<br> <br> Take up space!<br> <br> All public &#x2013; and even private &#x2013; spaces are dominated by men. Women and non-binary people taking back space is a radical act of liberation.<br> <br> Women and non-binary people: Our songs are for you. Everyone is welcome at our shows, but we don&#x2019;t write feminist music just so men can block your view!<br> <br> After every single show, women and non-binary people tell us how much they appreciate being in a space where they can dance and have fun together. We say &#x2018;Girls to the front&#x2019; in honour of our Riot Grrrl fore-sisters, but we really mean&#x2026;<br> <br> Men to the back!<br> <br> We didn&#x2019;t spend years at shows growing up (unable to see, groped and violently pushed) to recreate the same feelings in our female fans. All our male fans stand at the back, in a small but vital act of allyship.<br> <br> Hopefully one day we won&#x2019;t have to say it any more. Hopefully one day we&#x2019;ll live in a world where male entitlement no longer exists, and where women feel truly safe.<br> <br> But until that world is built from our blood, sweat and bare hands&#x2026;<br> <br> GIRLS TO THE FRONT!"}]}
