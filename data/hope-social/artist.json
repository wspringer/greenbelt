Not Hope and Social, whose audiences have been known literally to become part of the performance. With uplifting, anthemic songs (imagine Paul McCartney fronting the E Street Band) their acts of levelling and empowerment make them Greenbelt perennial favourites. We&#x2019;re proper chuffed to have them back."}]}
