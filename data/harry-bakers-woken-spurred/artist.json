From winning his school&apos;s Battle of the Bands competition with a Jay-Z maths homage, to his prime number poetry TED talk being watched by millions online, Harry&apos;s love of language and logic has got him through literal marathons, seen him rap battle in front of Ice Cube, and now has him analysing the technical accuracy of So Solid Crew&apos;s 21 seconds. He&apos;s got 99 problems but maths ain&apos;t one."}]}
