Greenbelt loves a maverick, and Frank does things on his own terms, with his heart on his sleeve and songs that bridge the personal and the political, the intimate and the universal. We&#x2019;ve wanted to bring him to the festival for a very long time, and it&#x2019;s fitting that he comes to us now with his new Clive James-inspired album Be More Kind &#x2013; perfect for our vexed and divided times."}]}
